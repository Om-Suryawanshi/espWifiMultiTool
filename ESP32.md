## 1. BLE Passive Reconnaissance & Tracking Tool
Before any attack, a red teamer performs reconnaissance. This tool helps you passively map out and identify all BLE devices in your vicinity without alerting them.

The Goal: To identify and fingerprint potential targets. This includes finding smart locks, corporate access badges, medical devices, or fitness trackers that might be vulnerable.

How it Works: You program the ESP32 to continuously scan for BLE "advertisement packets." It then logs the MAC address, device name, and signal strength (RSSI) of every device it hears. By logging the RSSI over time, you can even track the physical movement of a device (and its owner) within a building.

Red Team Value: This is pure intelligence gathering. You can identify high-value targets, learn their unique identifiers for spoofing attacks, and understand device density in an area.

What You'll Need: An ESP32 and an optional MicroSD card module to log data over long periods.

## 2. BLE Spoofing & Cloning Attack (Evil Twin)
This project involves impersonating a legitimate BLE device to trick a phone or computer into connecting to your malicious ESP32.

The Goal: To create a convincing clone of a trusted device (like a smart watch, headphones, or a proximity tag like a Tile/AirTag) to perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack.

How it Works: First, you use your reconnaissance tool to get the exact name and MAC address of the target device. Then, you program your ESP32 to broadcast the exact same information. You can even increase the transmission power of the ESP32 so that a user's phone sees your "evil twin" as a stronger signal and connects to it automatically.

Red Team Value: Once the victim connects to you, you can attempt to capture authentication credentials, send malformed data to the user's app, or simply deny them service by preventing a connection to their real device.

What You'll Need: Just an ESP32.

## 3. BLE Jamming (Denial of Service)
This is a direct Denial of Service (DoS) attack that prevents any nearby BLE devices from communicating effectively.

The Goal: To disrupt or completely block BLE communications in a targeted area. This could be used to disable BLE security sensors, smart locks, or other connected devices.

How it Works: BLE uses three specific channels (37, 38, and 39) for advertising and establishing connections. The ESP32 can be programmed to flood these three channels with a massive amount of random advertising packets. This "signal noise" drowns out legitimate devices, preventing them from forming or maintaining connections.

Red Team Value: This demonstrates a powerful DoS attack. It can be a primary objective (disabling a security system) or a secondary one to force a device to disconnect, allowing you to intercept its reconnection attempt.

What You'll Need: Just an ESP32.

## 4. GATT Fuzzing for Vulnerability Discovery
This is a more advanced project aimed at finding unknown bugs (zero-days) in a target device's software.

The Goal: To crash a BLE device or cause it to behave in unexpected ways by sending it malformed data, potentially revealing a critical vulnerability like a buffer overflow.

How it Works: Once the ESP32 connects to a target BLE device, it identifies all its available services and characteristics through the Generic Attribute Profile (GATT). It then systematically sends invalid, oversized, or random data to each of these characteristics, hoping one of the inputs isn't handled correctly by the device's firmware.

Red Team Value: This is how real-world vulnerability researchers find new exploits. A successful fuzzing attack is the first step in developing a custom exploit that could lead to remote code execution or full device takeover.

What You'll Need: An ESP32 and a target BLE device you are willing to potentially break (like a cheap smart bulb or fitness band).

## 5. Wireless HID Attack (Bluetooth "BadUSB")
This turns the ESP32 into a malicious wireless keyboard that injects keystrokes into a paired computer or smartphone.

The Goal: To gain remote control over a victim's machine by executing commands as if you were typing on their keyboard.

How it Works: You program the ESP32 to act as a Bluetooth Human Interface Device (HID). A red teamer would use social engineering to trick the user into pairing with the device just once (e.g., by naming it "Logitech Keyboard"). From that point on, whenever your ESP32 is in Bluetooth range, it can automatically reconnect and run pre-programmed scripts to open a terminal, download malware, and execute it, all without any physical connection.

Red Team Value: Demonstrates persistent, wireless payload delivery. It's stealthier than a physical BadUSB because it doesn't require repeated physical access to a USB port.

What You'll Need: An ESP32.
